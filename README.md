# Fly higher

My first android game published to google play

## What is this game?
It's a simple, skill game in which you have to fly as high as you can.
Touching wall when its color is different than yours will make your spaceship explode ;)

## How it's made?
I used Unity, Microsoft Visual Studio and GIMP.

## Where to find?
For now it's avalivable on Google Play only

I just started using GitHub, that's why there is not much history of this repository.

Earlier I used to use Unity's version control system.
